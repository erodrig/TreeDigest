# TreeDigest

**TreeDigest** is an advanced project analysis and code exploration tool designed to provide in-depth insights into the structure and functionality of complex codebases, particularly for Node.js and Python applications. It scans all project files and generates a clear tree structure, delivering detailed summaries for each file. These summaries include model names, class names, method names, and concise descriptions of their purpose.

A key feature of TreeDigest is its **efficient checksum mechanism**, which tracks changes in the code. By comparing file checksums, it processes only newly added or modified files, ensuring optimal performance even for large projects. The analysis results and checksums are stored in two dot-prefixed files, making it easy to manage and review.

**Use Cases**:
- **Ticketing System Integration**: TreeDigest can be seamlessly integrated into ticketing systems, adding valuable code insights and points of interest to tickets. Developers can quickly identify relevant code paths and specific areas that need attention, boosting productivity and collaboration.
  
- **AI-Assisted Development**: TreeDigest empowers AI tools by selecting relevant code paths for analysis and automatically including them in the AI context. This enables developers to ask more informed questions or even have AI-generated code targeted at specific parts of the project, making it a powerful companion for AI-assisted coding.

- **Enhanced Knowledge Base**: TreeDigest supports the input of documentation from external sources to further improve results and enrich the knowledge base. This allows the tool to deliver even more comprehensive insights by combining code analysis with additional documentation, creating a more robust resource for developers.

Whether you need an organized overview of your codebase, automated updates to tickets, smarter AI code analysis, or a richer knowledge base, TreeDigest is the ideal solution for developers seeking efficiency and clarity in their development workflow.
